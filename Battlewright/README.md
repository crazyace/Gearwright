# Battlewright

What to press next: a rotation helper for **World of Warcraft: Forever**, and
Gearwright's sibling (Gearwright sorts out your gear; Battlewright your fight).

> Status: **first draft, untested in game.** Rogue only (Assassination, Combat,
> Subtlety). Whether it can work on Forever at all depends on what the game lets
> addons read in combat: run `/gwp combat` with GearwrightProbe first.

## What it shows

- A big icon: the next ability. Greyed out with a countdown while you wait for energy.
- A small icon beside it: a cooldown worth using now (Adrenaline Rush, Blade Flurry,
  Cold Blood).
- A line under it saying why ("Slice and Dice is down", "full combo points").

It shows in combat (and, with `/bw target`, when you target an enemy). If the game hides
the combat data it needs, it says so instead of guessing.

## Rogue priorities (first version)

1. From stealth: Ambush, Garrote or Cheap Shot (Combat opens with Cheap Shot).
2. Slice and Dice when it's down or about to fall off (2 s).
3. Rupture at full combo points on a target above 50% health (Assassination, Subtlety).
4. Eviscerate at full combo points (4 with Mutilate, else 5), or 3+ on a target under 25%.
5. Build: Riposte after a parry; Mutilate (Assassination), Ghostly Strike or Hemorrhage
   (Subtlety), else Sinister Strike.

The spec comes from your talents' spells (Mutilate, Hemorrhage, Blade Flurry...), or
`/bw spec`.

## Commands

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `/bw unlock`, `/bw lock` | Move the icon (drag it), then lock it |
| `/bw scale 1.2` | Icon size (0.5-2) |
| `/bw spec combat` | Play a spec regardless of talents (`auto` to go back) |
| `/bw target` | Also show out of combat with an enemy targeted |
| `/bw on`, `/bw off` | Turn it on or off |
| `/bw reset` | Put the icon back in the middle |
